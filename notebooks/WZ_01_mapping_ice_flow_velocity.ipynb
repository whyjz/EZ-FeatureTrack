    "## Motivation and Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations of ice flow velocity provide a key component for modeling glacier dynamics and mass balance. The feature tracking technique is one of the most commonly used methods for deriving ice flow velocity from remote sensing data. Despite being cost-effective compared to field measurements, running a feature tracking workflow is not easy because 1) searching for good data can be time-consuming; 2) fetching data can be challenging because the source images often have a large size; and, 3) there is no standardized pipeline for feature tracking processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we present an interactive, notebook-based interface that deploys the entire feature tracking workflow. This open-source tool aims to provide researchers, educators, and other users an easy way to perform glacier feature tracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- We develop a fully customizable and extensible workflow for mapping glacier velocities using the feature tracking technique.\n",
    "- We develop two Python libraries, GeoStacks and EZTrack, for general spatial and domain-specific processes respectively. For details about GeoStacks, see our another submission entitled **GeoStacks: a library for efficient query and stacking of satellite remote sensing data sets** at the EarthCube meeting 2021.\n",
    "- We build a Jupyter notebook interface for each step in the feature tracking workflow, including data query, parameter selection, and interactive visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The modularizes workflow consists of the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. query data \n",
    "2. retrieve and aggregate data into system memory \n",
    "3. select feature tracking kernel and parameters\n",
    "4. filter data for feature enhancement\n",
    "5. perform feature tracking \n",
    "6. mask outliers and interpolate results as needed \n",
    "7. visualize and export results\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine multiple open sources packages for most of these routines, including `pandas`, `geopandas`, `shapely`, `ipyleaflet`, `ipywidgets`, `xarray`, `rasterio`, and `matplotlib`. For the first steps, we use the **GeoStacks** package showcasing its potential application. For this demo notebook, we use CARST (Cryosphere And Remote Sensing Toolkit) and ITS_LIVE as the core feature tracking processes and data sources. CARST uses the NCC kernel `ampcor` from the ISCE software for feature tracking. Nevertheless, the feature tracking kernel and all related filters, masks, and interpolation processes can be easily replaced by other tools from a different feature tracking package (e.g., autoRIFT; Lei et al., 2021). or a user-defined function \n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "In our demo notebook, we query data over Jakobshavn Isbræ, a large outlet glacier of the Greenland Ice Sheet with a history of seasonal flow speed variation (Khazendar et al., 2019 and Riel et al., 2021). Users can choose to explore the readily available ITS_LIVE velocity or perform feature tracking using the Landsat 8 imagery. In this mini-study, We derive the spring speed change of Jakobshavn Isbræ during 2015-2021 (a few weeks before the EC meeting) using both ITS_LIVE and CARST-derived data, and find that the slowdown event at Jakobshavn in 2017/2018 seems to not last long. In 2021, Jakobshavn's spring speed increases and likely reaches back to the peak between 2013 and 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo notebook provide an easy and interactive way to deploy the entire feature tracking application. We expect to see it opens a way for researchers to explore new data, compare different algorithms, and visualize and validate their results. This tool also shows a full potential on education uses since it lowers the technical threshold for manipulating satellite data and deriving glacier speeds. The modules used by this demo notebook, including the GeoStacks and CARST packages, are open-source software and welcome community contributions.\n",
