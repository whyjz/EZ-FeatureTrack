    "## Motivation and Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations of ice flow velocity provide a key component for modeling glacier dynamics and mass balance. Applying a feature-tracking technique to satellite visible or synthetic aperture radar imagery is one of the most commonly used methods for deriving ice flow velocity from remote sensing data. Despite being cost-effective compared to field measurements, implementing a feature-tracking workflow is not trivial because: \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Searching for high-quality data can be time consuming\n",
    " 2. Fetching large-volume source imagery can be logistically challenging\n",
    " 3. There is no standardized pipeline for feature-tracking processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we present an interactive, notebook-based interface that deploys an entire feature tracking workflow. This open-source tool aims to provide researchers, educators, and other users an accessible and reproducible method for performing glacier feature tracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- We develop a fully customizable and extensible workflow for mapping glacier velocities using a feature-tracking technique.\n",
    "- We develop two Python libraries, [GeoStacks](https://github.com/geostacks/GeoStacks) and [EZTrack](https://github.com/whyjz/EZ-FeatureTrack), for general spatial and domain-specific processes respectively. For details about GeoStacks, see our other team submission entitled [**GeoStacks: a library for efficient query and stacking of satellite remote sensing data sets**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geostacks/GeoStacks/earthcube).\n",
    "- We build a Jupyter notebook interface for each step in our feature-tracking workflow, including data query, parameter selection, and interactive visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The modularized workflow consists of the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Query data \n",
    "2. Retrieve and aggregate data into system memory \n",
    "3. Select feature-tracking kernel and parameters\n",
    "4. Filter data for feature enhancement\n",
    "5. Perform feature tracking \n",
    "6. Mask outliers and interpolate results as needed \n",
    "7. Visualize and export results\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine multiple open sources packages for most of these routines, including `pandas`, `geopandas`, `shapely`, `ipyleaflet`, `ipywidgets`, `xarray`, `rasterio`, and `matplotlib`. For the first steps, we use the **GeoStacks** package to showcase its potential application. For this demo notebook, we use [CARST](https://github.com/whyjz/CARST) (Cryosphere And Remote Sensing Toolkit) and ITS_LIVE as the core feature tracking processes and data sources. CARST uses the NCC kernel `ampcor` from the [ISCE software](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2) for feature tracking. Nevertheless, the feature tracking kernel and all related filters, masks, and interpolation processes can be easily replaced by other tools from a different feature tracking package (e.g., autoRIFT; Lei et al., 2021) or a user-defined function. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "In our demo notebook, we query data over Jakobshavn Isbræ, a large outlet glacier of the Greenland Ice Sheet with a history of seasonal flow speed variation (e.g., Khazendar et al., 2019; Riel et al., 2021). Users can choose to explore the readily available ITS_LIVE velocity or perform feature tracking using the Landsat 8 imagery. In this mini-study, we derive the spring speed change of Jakobshavn Isbræ during 2015--2021 (a few weeks before the EarthCube meeting) using both ITS_LIVE and CARST-derived data and find that the slowdown event at Jakobshavn in 2017/2018 seems to have been a temporary event: in 2021, Jakobshavn's spring speed increases and likely reaches back to the peak between 2013 and 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo notebook provides an easy and interactive way to deploy an entire feature-tracking use-case. This workflow will allow researchers of any skill level to explore new data, compare different algorithms, and visualize and validate their results. This tool also shows the full potential for education uses since it lowers the technical threshold for manipulating satellite data and deriving glacier speeds. The modules used by this demo notebook, including the GeoStacks and CARST packages, are open-source software and welcome community contributions.\n",

Our goal is to see the evolution of ice flow speed at Jakobshavn Isbræ, Greenland, since 2015. This outlet glacier experienced a multi-year slow-down event in at least 2017 and 2018 (e.g., Khazendar et al., 2019; Riel et al., 2021), and we will find whether this trend continues to 2021. \n",

    "We first retrieve ITS_LIVE ice speed over Jakobshavn from 2015 and 2018. Since ITS_LIVE does not provide any results after 2018, we use CARST to calculate ice speed Jakobshavn in 2021. We use spring (April) scenes from all these years to minimize the bias from seasonal speed variaion.\n",

    "Now switch the Data/Kernel to `CARST` and hit `Search for dates` button again. In the right panel, hold the Ctrl button and select `2021-04-17` and `2021-05-03`. Select `B4` as the input band, and click the `Get data` button. This will download the corresponding Landsat scenes and run feature tracking using the default parameter settings, which will take a few minutes on the Binder server (may be faster on your powerful local machine). You can also try to use Band 8 as input or change the parameter settings by running `cpanel.show_ft_params()` or tweaking `cpanel.ft_params.pxsettings`. Generally speaking, Band 8 needs 4X more time to process than Band 4 because its pixel spacing (15 m) is smaller than that of B4 (30 m). \n",
